# SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format)

[Introduction from Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/sarif-tutorials).

SARIF is a format based on JSON, used to capture warning messages from software tools that work with sourcecode.
Most importantly it can hold compiler warnings and findings from security scanners.
GitHub can then import these and maintain a browsable database of outstanding ones.
