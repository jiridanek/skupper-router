= Contributor's Guide

Use this guide to learn how to contribute to the Qpid Dispatch Router documentation. The documentation consists of a user guide, man pages, and a configuration reference. There are two contribution methods:

* xref:simple-change[Make a simple change to the documentation through the GitHub interface]. This method works well for quick fixes and simple additions.

* xref:large-contribution[Make a large or complex contribution]. This method involves forking the repository, editing the documentation files, and submitting a pull request.

[id='simple-change']
== Making a simple change to the documentation

Follow this process if you want to make a quick fix or simple addition to the user guide:

. Find the file you want to edit in the GitHub web interface.

. Click the file name to open it in GitHub.

. Click the pencil icon near the top right of the page contents. 

. Make your edits.
+
For more information, see link:style-guide.adoc[Style guidelines].

. In the `Propose file change` section at the bottom of the page, enter a title and description of your changes. Enter enough detail for reviewers to know what you have changed and why.

. Click *Propose file change* to create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.

. Click *Create pull request*.

. Wait. The documentation team will typically review pull requests within a few days.

[id='large-contribution']
== Making a large contribution to the documentation

To make a large or complex contribution to the user guide, follow this method.

=== Setting up your environment

Before making a documentation contribution, you must set up your environment. This involves forking the upstream GitHub repository and cloning the fork to your local machine.

. If necessary, install `git`. For more information, see link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[Installing Git].

. link:https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/[Set up authentication] to the skupper-router GitHub repository.

. Fork the link:https://github.com/skupperproject/skupper-router[skupper-router] GitHub repository.

. Clone your fork onto your local machine.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:__<your-user-name>__/skupper-router.git
----

. Navigate to the new directory.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ cd skupper-router
----

. Add a git remote to your local repository to link to the upstream version of the documentation.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:skupperproject/skupper-router.git
----

. Verify that the remotes are set up properly.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:__<your-user-name>__/skupper-router.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:__<your-user-name>__/skupper-router.git (push)
upstream	git@github.com:skupperproject/skupper-router.git (fetch)
upstream	git@github.com:skupperproject/skupper-router.git (push)

=== Updating the documentation

Updating the documentation involves fetching the latest code from the upstream repository, making your documentation changes, and submitting a pull request. The following procedure describes how this workflow typically works:

. Update your local repo with the latest changes from the upstream repository:

.. Check out the main branch locally.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ git checkout main
----

.. Fetch the current files from the upstream repository.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ git fetch upstream
----

.. Update your cloned main branch on your local machine with the current files from the upstream repository:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ git rebase upstream/main
----

.. Update your fork in GitHub (`origin`) with the current files from the upstream repository.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ git push origin main
----

. If there is not a JIRA for your documentation update, create one in the link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/DISPATCH[Apache Dispatch JIRA project].
+
--
When you create the JIRA:

* Select the `Documentation` component.
* Assign the JIRA to yourself.
--

. Create a branch on your local machine for the documentation update.
+
--
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ git checkout -b _<branch-name>_ upstream/main
----
The branch name should include the ID of the JIRA for which you are creating the documentation update.
--

. Make your changes to the documentation.
+
For more information, see link:style-guide.adoc[Style guidelines].

. Build the documentation locally to test your changes.
+
For more information, see link:../README.adoc[Building the documentation].

. When you are satisfied with your changes, commit them.

.. Verify the files that you have changed.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ git status
----

.. Stage the files that you changed.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ git add -A
----

.. Create a commit with the staged files.
+
--
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ git commit -m "_<commit-message>_"
----
For the commit message, write a short sentence that clearly describes the changes you made.
--

.. Push your changes to your fork in GitHub.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ git push origin HEAD
----

. In GitHub, create a pull request.

.. In the link:https://github.com/skupperproject/skupper-router[skupper-router] GitHub project, click *Pull requests*.

.. Click [btn]*New pull request*.

.. Click the *compare across forks* link.

.. In the head fork drop-down, select your fork, and in the compare drop-down, select the branch you created for this documentation update.

.. Review the diff to verify your changes one more time.

.. Click [btn]*Create pull request*.

.. Write a title and description for the pull request. The title must include the ID of the JIRA for this documentation update.

.. Click [btn]*Create pull request*.

. Wait. The documentation team will typically review pull requests within a few days.

[NOTE]
====
After the pull request has been merged or rejected, you can remove your feature branch from both the remote fork and your local machine. GitHub provides a button for removing from the fork in the UI of the PR once it is merged. To remove the branch from your local machine, enter `git branch -d _<branch-name>_`.
